# Password Strength Checker

A Python program that evaluates the strength of passwords and provides detailed feedback. This project demonstrates Python fundamentals, user input validation, and real-world problem solving.

## Features

- Checks passwords for multiple criteria:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Provides feedback for each rule
- Assigns an overall password strength: Weak, Medium, or Strong
- Modular, reusable Python functions

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/EmilyMcCrory16/password-strength-checker.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd password-strength-checker
3. Run the program:
   python password_checker.py

## Example Output
Enter a password: Password1!
Password Feedback:
✓ Password length is sufficient
✓ Contains an uppercase letter
✓ Contains a lowercase letter
✓ Contains a number
✓ Contains a special character

Overall Password Strength: Strong

## Built With
